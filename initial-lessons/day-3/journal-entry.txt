Day #3: I learned Hiragana and practiced it on ReadTheKanji! At the end of the day I found out this website that really helped me learn all the hiragana very fast, linked below.

Day #4: I continued learning Hiragana and got all of them down, though I mess them up sometimes, so I kept practicing a bit. Later on I learned a tiny bit of Katakana.

Day #5: I learned more Katakana and got all of them down, same thing as above, messing them up sometimes. Then, I practiced a bit of both Hiragana and Katakana on Read The Kanji.

Day #6: A bit of a junction of days rather than one specific day, same as above kind of but this is way more of a junction than the above days.

I kept practicing the kanas in readthekanji.com. Classes were back so it became a bit busy, but I practiced a little bit everyday. I also scheduled classes with a friend who's really good at japanese, and he will help me learn, not just for me but also for himself since he wants to become a teacher.

He gave me my first assignment, which was to write down all the kanas twice on paper. I did that in the next couple days learning a bit of the stroke order and sent it to him.

- Overall it's been... 11 days or so of japanese learning so far, I think.
