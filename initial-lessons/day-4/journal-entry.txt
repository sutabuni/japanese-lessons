// DAY 7
Today I had my first lesson with my friend, Will. He was an awesome teacher, and I learned a bunch of common japanese expressions which was really cool. He gave me an assignment to do before Thursday. I will leave all the resources related to lessons with him in a folder in here.
- PS: Remember to ask for a notebook so I can note down japanese lesson stuff. He said to note things down as much as possible to practice handwriting and also stroke order which is very important, especially for kanji.
