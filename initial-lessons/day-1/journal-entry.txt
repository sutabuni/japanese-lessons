- I've learned that japanese has three ways of writing their words: Katakana, which is used for foreign words, hiragana which is used for japanese words, and Kanji which is an adoption of chinese symbols. Katakana and Hiragana are more or less clones of each other. They tend to contain one vowel and one consonant, with certain exceptions. The only lone consonant used is n, and vowels may be used by themselves (I think).

- I've learned about pitch accents, and that japanese words do not use stressed words like english ones do. Instead, they fluctuate only pitch and nothing else. That means volume does not change, the syllable length does not change and the vowels do not change, only pitch. There is also a specific rhythm to how pitch fluctuates, usually starting low and going high. On some words, you go low at the end.

- Pitch patterns: default melody, which starts low then goes high. Downstep after the first syllable, which starts high then goes low. And downstep elsewhere, which can be like starting low, going high until downstep then going low again.

- I learned about the Japanese consonants, which I did not memorize but I get a general idea of how they work and they don't seem very hard for me to do, but I don't know if I'm doing them right.

- I learned about the Japanese vowels, which again I did not memorize but I have a general idea of how they work and I didn't seem to have a hard time with them. Except devoiced vowels, those seemed hard.
